# DNDOptimizer
Optimizer AI for all things D&amp;D

The goal of this project is to digitize everything Dungeons and Dragons, and generate AI for all aspects. Some samples of applications include:

<ul>
  <li>Testing a specific build across multiple monster types/challenge ratings</li>
  <li>Testing specific parties through a specific module</li>
  <li>Adjusting modules to provide a specific difficulty to the specific party</li>
  <li>Generating the best build of a single character, given some or no specs</li>
    <ul><li>I.e. Kenku Bard given, stat distribution/class options/skills/equipment left to AI to generate</li></ul>
  <li>Generating party of N characters given some or no specs, that can best handle specified campaign</li>
    <ul>
      <li>This is useful when a one-shot is needed, and players need quick characters</li>
      <li>Multiple different parties can be generated for the same campaign</li>
    </ul>
  <li>Modifying specific monster to match a specific challenge rating and/or role, while staying thematic</li>
  <li>Generating world map with dungeons and historical locations/civilizations</li>
</ul>
